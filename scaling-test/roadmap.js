//Check if there are any users that are marked "Yet to play"
//If not...
  //Pull all users
  //Pull down code for each of those users
  //Assign all users to a game
  //Store all the games that need to be resolved in a "game queue"
  //(This is the "restart the process" script)


//Run all this every so often...(once per hour?)

//Periodic Script 
//shift the next game (or 3 games) off the queue,
//start up dockers for each of the users in that game,
